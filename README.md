# Resume with Hugo

This project generates a personal resume using Hugo, a static site generator.

The resume is defined in config.toml and is styled using the [companion Hugo theme](https://github.com/gabrielelucci/hugo-devresume-theme).

## TODO

- Define the resume as a JSON file, possibly using [JSON resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema), instead of TOML.
- Make the JSON itself downloadable.
