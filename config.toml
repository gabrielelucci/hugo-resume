Hi there! I'm a software developer with professional experience __Python__ and __Javascript/Node.js__, mostly on the backend side of web development. I'm a detail-oriented perfectionist, but also versatile and always looking for new challenges. I love working with Django (who doesn't?), but I'm always open to learning new technologies. I've been using __Linux__ since I was 14 (I use Arch Linux by the way) and I like to tinker with containers.

In my spare time, I like engaging in various music-related activities, such as going to concerts, clubbing, and playing bass guitar with my band. I also enjoy playing videogames (on Linux, of course), board games with friends, and inline skating.

I was part of the IT team at the [Institute for Biomedicine](https://www.eurac.edu/en/institutes-center/institute-for-biomedicine) of [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu), and I worked mainly on the [CHRIS-2D](https://www.eurac.edu/en/institutes-center/institute-for-biomedicine/projects/chris-2d) project, for which I developed the "dynamic data portal", a website that allows researchers (even of external insitutions too) to browse a set of the data gathered by Eurac's IfB studies. The portal enables researchers to request data by filing a detailed application with the desired set of variables, and also handles the approval workflow of the application by the IfB staff.

Due to the small size of our development team, we decided to build the portal as a full-stack Django application. This also included an HTTP API for complementary CLI tools. I played a significant role in deciding the project's architecture and implementation, and I am very happy with the final result!

Employed by DEPP first, and by the Gran Sasso Science Institute then, I worked for the [Openpolis foundation](https://www.openpolis.it/), developing various web applications and toolkits using Django and Python.

Those are the most relevant projects I worked on, with a link to the git-forge repository if available:

  - __[op-povedu](https://gitlab.depp.it/openpolis/op-pov-edu)__ - _"Povertà Educativa"_: a Django application which gathers socio-economic data about education and minors in Italy, organizing everything into a strucutred database (queryable via Metabase) and handy CSVs. This data is then analyzed and used to produce [articles and media](https://www.openpolis.it/poverta-educativa/). I've been the lead developer since the beginning. I made extensive use of _[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)_ (which I love, by the way) to transform and aggregate data.

  - __[opdm-service](https://gitlab.depp.it/openpolis/opdm/opdm-service/)__ - _["La Mappa del Potere"](https://service.opdm.openpolis.io)_: currently Openpolis most important project, a service which gathers, organizes and serves data about political power in Italy. I co-designed and implemented parts of the REST API (using [django-rest-framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org)), and developed a lot of data import tasks, often using _SPARQL_ to query relevant stuff from RDF structures.

  - __[django-popolo](https://github.com/openpolis/django-popolo)__: a Django app which implements [Popolo](https://www.popoloproject.com/), a set of open government data specifications. This is a core part of opdm-service, implementing the data structure.

  - __[django-uwsgi-taskmanager](https://github.com/openpolis/django-uwsgi-taskmanager)__: a Django app to manage async tasks via the admin interface, using the uWSGI spooler. This is also a core part of opdm-service, used to run and schedule tasks such as importing new data and keeping existing data up-to-date.

  - __[opdm-etl](https://gitlab.depp.it/openpolis/opdm/opdm-etl)__: a Python micro-framework which abstracts __ETL__ pipelines.

  - __[op-politiche-2018](https://gitlab.depp.it/openpolis/politiche-2018)__ - _["A schede scoperte"](https://www.openpolis.it/a-schede-scoperte/)"_: an application which, provided an address, gives you the names of the candidates on the voting paper for the 2018 Italian general election, while also telling you their poltical career and economic interests (e.g their roles in companies). I worked on the backend, developing the REST API with _django-rest-framework_.

I was the lead (and basically the only) developer of "APA Cloud", a suite of server side applications that gather, store and visualize air quality sensor data.

Since I enjoy working with containers and administering systems, on my free time I mantain an array of self-hosted services, hosted on a couple of rented servers.

Some of the services I run:
 - a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) server, which I use daily to backup my photos, store documents and sync contacts and calendars between my personal devices.
 - [Grocy](https://grocy.info/), an ERP for managing groceries and alike.
 - a bunch of [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) nodes ([Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/it), [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/))
 - a Minecraft server, because… why not?
  - this very website!

Everything is deployed [using docker-compose](https://gitlab.com/gabrielelucci/cloud) on a Linux hosts.

In the end, I'm quite proud of this project. I'm learning a lot from it, while it provides me with a safe place for my data and a bunch of useful services.
